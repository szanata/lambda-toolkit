# Lambda Toolkit

A set of tools to simplify Node Js code development specific for AWS Lambdas, including common functions and AWS SDK v3 abstractions.

## Dependencies

This project has no dependency other than `devDependencies`. As this is intended to be use at AWS Lambda runtimes, it assumes `@aws-sdk/*` packages are available at the environment and does not ship them.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available under [docs/](https://github.com/szanata/lambda-toolkit/blob/master/docs/index.md) at the repo.
